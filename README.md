# SmartContracts-Audit-Report

We begin with automated tools to get a quick overview of the overall picture and then rely on manual code review and static analysis to base our decisions

After the initial review we group and filter all of our findings and investigate manually every issue that we consider problematic 

This means creating sandboxes and testing environments and testing functions in question from every angle to come to decisive conclusion and suggest our recommendations

Our methodology is also described in the report
